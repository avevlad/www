<h3>When a child has not started reading by itself</h3>

A child with good language comprehension has good vocabulary and conceptual understanding. Good language comprehension
is the most important prerequisite for successful
learning. All learning is based on language and is achieved through listening, speech, reading and writing. Therefore
good language comprehension is extremely important. Language
comprehension needs to grow in parallel with the child‘s development and its educational
needs. For this reason it is very important to strengthen it from the very beginning. The
vocabulary we use in our daily lives is rather repetitive but text can be diverse and varied.
For this reason, reading to children and discussing it afterwards is so important.

<h3>When a child has started reading by itself</h3>

One of the best ways to assess the child‘s reading comprehension and help it increase it, is
to give it the opportunity to talk about what it has read. It can be challenging to describe a
sequence of events or persons and characters, to give account of facts or cause and effect,
but the child‘s descriptions can give us an idea of how well the child has understood what
it has read. Discussions also give the child an opportunity to connect the subject to its own
experiences or to something it read earlier. Not least, it gives the child practice in expressing
its thoughts coherently.

Of course the age and developmental stage of the child determines the complexity of the
information it can give about the content of a text, but it is important to give the child the
opportunity to reflect and inquire about new words it has discovered. Our vocabulary is
mostly limited to our daily activities, while books contain all the ideas and vocabulary of the
world. That is why we get smarter by reading and students with good vocabulary do better
